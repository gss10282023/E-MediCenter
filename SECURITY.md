# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security updates are provided for the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred: use GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” feature (Security tab) if it’s enabled for the repository.

If private reporting is not available:

1. Open a GitHub issue with minimal details (no exploit code, no secrets).
2. Ask maintainers for a private channel to continue the discussion.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days.
